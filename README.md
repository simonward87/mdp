# Markdown Preview Tool

Opinionated command line tool for previewing markdown files. Built as a learning exercise, but also because I needed a tool to preview my markdown.

## Minification

Template is manually minified using an [online minifier](https://go.tacodewolff.nl/minify) by [Taco de Wolff](https://github.com/tdewolff).

## To-do

- [ ] Embed font files to ensure consistency across browsers and operating systems
- [ ] Provide local font-face source, so local fonts can be used when available
- [ ] Implement `--host` option to allow connection to stay open
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add build & usage instructions
