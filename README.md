# Markdown Preview Tool

Opinionated command line tool for previewing markdown files. Built as a learning exercise, but also because I needed a tool to preview my markdown.

## To-do

- [ ] Embed font files to ensure consistency across browsers and operating systems
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add build & usage instructions
